docs.page is a free Open Source project that allows you to create instant, fast and beautiful documentation with zero configuration.

Documentation is one of the important aspects of many projects. However, many people consider it tiring and time-consuming to create a custom documentation website for each project And, whereas many common solutions to problems have to be duplicated, there is still the issue of dealing with overheads such as website maintenance & hosting.

More so, even though solutions such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/),
[docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) and many others, are great projects, they still require custom setup for each project
and regular maintenance.

This is where docs.page comes in providing long-lasting solutions to all these. It is designed to deliver instant documentation websites, with the content sourced directly from any public GitHub repository. 

## Features include:

- [Configurable](/configuration): This helps you to add your own logo, theme, analytics, navigation and more, with a simple config file.
- [Previewing](/previews): This is where you view the documentation of any branch, pull request or specific commit.
- [GitHub Bot](/github-bot): This aids you to install our [GitHub bot](https://github.com/apps/docs-page) to automatically get a URL to pull request documentation previews.
- [Components](/components): It is powered by [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), and uses React components such as Tabs (useful for projects with multiple languages) directly in your docs.
- [Search](/search): This is for you to easily add full search support powered by [DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/).
- [Custom Domains](/custom-domains): Serve your documentation using your own domain.

### Other useful features include:

- Global variable injection (for managing common variables across the project).
- Displaying assets using GitHub.
- Dark/Light mode.
- Responsive.
- Code block highlighting and content copying.
- Page redirects.
- Per-page metadata support via Frontmatter.

## Should I use docs.page?

docs.page is a simple way to generate a documentation website with zero effort. It generally works for documentation websites with a lot of Markdown based content.
If you require features which are more specific to your own project, a custom solution might work better.
